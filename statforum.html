    <h1>Welcome to the Statistics Support Space</h1>
    <p>Your friendly place to learn, ask questions, and build confidence</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>Iâ€™m here to help you feel confident and succeed in statistics.</strong></p>
      <p>Whether youâ€™d like to review assignments, practice problems, or talk through concepts in a relaxed setting, this is your space to ask questions and get support.</p>
      <p><em>Statistics is just an approximation!</em></p>
      <p>A good approximation is transparent about its assumptions, honest about its uncertainty, and useful for decisions.</p>

      <h2>Why This Forum?</h2>
      <p>I understand that many of you may find it difficult to ask questions during classâ€”sometimes because of the pace, sometimes due to language barriers, and sometimes because it feels intimidating.</p>
      <p>I created this space to make sure you always have a place to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask questions freely, without fear of judgment.</li>
        <li>Get extra support if you come from underrepresented or minority groups in STEM.</li>
        <li>Overcome language or cultural barriers that may make participation in large lectures harder.</li>
        <li>Build confidence in your understanding of statistics at your own pace.</li>
      </ul>

        <div class="about-text">
          <p>Hello! Iâ€™m <strong>Pankaj Bhagwat</strong>, a Postdoctoral Fellow in Statistics at the University of Alberta.</p>
          <p>I teach introductory and applied statistics courses (STAT 151 and STAT 161), where my focus is helping students not only learn statistical methods but also see their relevance in real-world contextsâ€”from business and economics to health and data science.</p>
          <p>I believe statistics is the formal language of common sense. My goal is to make it approachable, inclusive, and practical.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Active learning:</strong> asking questions, working with real data, and discussing ideas together.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility & inclusivity:</strong> ensuring students from diverse backgrounds feel supported.</li>
            <li><strong>Critical thinking:</strong> using statistics as tools for reasoning under uncertainty, not just formulas.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In short: I want you to leave my courses with both confidence in your skills and an appreciation for how statistics empowers decision-making in the real world.</p>
